# ledger-jsonrpc

A vouchfx sample proving the engine can orchestrate and test a polyglot system consuming
**Community-tier providers** from the [vouchfx-providers](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx-providers)
hub. The service here is a hand-rolled JSON-RPC 2.0 ledger API (Node.js); the suite exercises
REST calls, database rows, broker events, and independent consumer workflows — all wired through
a **custom runner** that the stock `vouchfx` engine CLI cannot run, because the CLI ships only
the frozen Core provider catalogue.

## What this demonstrates

**Four important firsts for vouchfx:**

1. **First sample consuming a Community provider** — `rpc.json-rpc` (the
   [`Vouchfx.Community.JsonRpc`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vouchfx.Community.JsonRpc)
   NuGet package from [vouchfx-providers](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx-providers))
   is not in the engine's frozen Core set; the stock CLI cannot load it. This sample shows the
   **reference pattern** for anyone who needs to consume hub providers before a provider-loader
   milestone: build a thin custom runner.

2. **First sample using `mq-publish.kafka`** — unlike `mq-expect.kafka` (which *asserts* an
   event exists), `mq-publish.kafka` lets the suite itself *inject* test data onto a broker.
   The suite here uses it to bypass the JSON-RPC surface entirely, feeding the worker role a
   message directly and proving it independently consumes and writes to the database.

3. **First sample using `script.csharp`** — a short C# snippet bridges an engine-staged variable
   name (which contains forbidden characters) into a placeholder-safe name that later steps
   reference. A workaround, but also a genuine feature: authors can run arbitrary C# assertions
   between steps.

4. **First multi-service sample** — the topology contains two containers from one image, each
   selecting a different role via the `ROLE` environment variable. The suite exercises both
   independently and proves they coordinate via the broker.

The sample is also the **first real demonstration** of a distributed business transaction that
isn't a CRUD read-back: a REST call triggers a database write *and* an asynchronous workflow
(Kafka consumer → second write) that the REST surface doesn't orchestrate directly. vouchfx sees
the whole story end-to-end.

```

Both `ledger-api` and `ledger-worker` run as ordinary containers (`environment.services`);
Postgres and Kafka run as vouchfx-managed Aspire dependencies (`environment.dependencies`).
The two containers share one image but execute different role-specific startup paths selected
by the `ROLE` environment variable — a production pattern the suite proves end-to-end.

## The custom runner: why it exists

The vouchfx engine CLI ships with 25 **Core providers** (frozen at build time for v1.x). The
`rpc.json-rpc` provider in the vouchfx-providers hub is **Community-tier** — maintained outside
the engine, published as an independent NuGet package. Providers are compile-time plugins
(§5.8 of the [engine blueprint](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx/blob/main/docs/01_Technical_Architecture_and_Engineering_Blueprint.md)),
not runtime-loaded extensions. The stock CLI has no seam to discover or load Community providers.

**The workaround (today's state):** build a custom runner. This project's `runner/` is exactly
that — a ~330-line C# program that:

1. Loads the stock engine's public SDK interfaces (`ScenarioRunner`, `StepKindRegistry`, etc.)
2. References `Vouchfx.Community.JsonRpc` directly via NuGet
3. Constructs a frozen provider registry over the four Core providers this suite needs
   **plus** the Community `rpc.json-rpc` provider
4. Discovers and runs `.e2e.yaml` files against that registry
5. Produces the exact same JUnit XML and HTML reports as the stock CLI

This is the **reference pattern** for anyone consuming hub providers before a provider-loader
feature ships. The runner is minimal but production-grade: it mirrors the engine CLI's
`RunCommand.cs` path exactly, reusing its discovery, parsing, validation, and execution
logic.

**Run it like this:**

```bash
# List every step kind the runner knows about (Community + Core)
dotnet run --project samples/ledger-jsonrpc/runner --list

# Run the suite (run-sample.sh auto-detects the custom runner)
dotnet run --project samples/ledger-jsonrpc/runner -c Release -- \
  samples/ledger-jsonrpc/tests --html out/ledger-report.html --junit out/ledger-results.xml
```

See the **How to run** section below for the production convenience script.

## The app (`app/`)

One Node.js 22 image, dual-role:

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/server.js` | HTTP entrypoint. Selects role via `ROLE` env var, serves `GET /` (readiness), sets up Postgres and Kafka. |
| `src/api.js` | JSON-RPC 2.0 handler (`POST /rpc`): `createAccount`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `getAccount`. Hand-rolled (not delegated to a library) to show the protocol's rules explicitly. Domain error code: `-32001` (INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS). |
| `src/db.js` | Postgres pool and schema: `accounts` table (id, balance, created_at) and `adjustments` table (id, account_id, delta, reason, applied_at). Reads env vars `PG*` (standard libpq names). |
| `src/kafka.js` | Kafka client, producer (for `ledger-api` role), consumer (for `ledger-worker` role), topic provisioning. Reads `KAFKA_BROKERS` (comma-separated `host:port`). |
| `src/worker.js` | Kafka consumer message processor for `ledger-worker` role: reads `{accountId, delta, reason}`, applies a transactional balance adjustment, logs to the `adjustments` table. |

**Startup contract (health gate):**

- `GET /` answers `503 {"status":"starting"}` until Postgres and Kafka are both provisioned
  (schema created, topics exist) and, for `ROLE=api`, the producer is connected
  (for `ROLE=worker`, the consumer subscription is active).
- Once ready, `GET /` returns `200 {"status":"ready", "role":"<role>"}`.
- If dependencies do not become reachable within 60 seconds, the service logs the failure
  and stays not-ready forever (no crash loop) — the suite's health gate will timeout and
  report EnvironmentError.

**Endpoints:**

`ledger-api` (`ROLE=api`):
- `GET /` — readiness probe (as above).
- `POST /rpc` — JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response. Methods:
  - `createAccount(ownerName: string)` → `{accountId: string}` (new account created with balance 0).
  - `deposit(accountId: string, amount: number)` → `{accountId: string, balance: number}` (balance after deposit).
  - `withdraw(accountId: string, amount: number)` → `{balance: number}`, or error `-32001`
    (insufficient funds) if balance < amount.
  - `getAccount(accountId: string)` → `{accountId: string, balance: number}`, or error `-32004` (account not found).
  
  **Security note:** The JSON-RPC endpoint is deliberately unauthenticated — it is an ephemeral,
  network-isolated test system under test. Do not copy this design to production services.

- Publishes `{"type":"funds.deposited", ...}` to the `ledger-events` Kafka topic after every
  successful `deposit`, and `{"type":"funds.withdrawn", ...}` after every successful `withdraw`.
  (Publication failures are logged and swallowed — the HTTP response already went out, so an
  event-pipeline hiccup must not fail an otherwise successful transaction.)

`ledger-worker` (`ROLE=worker`):
- `GET /` — readiness probe (as above).
- No other HTTP surface. In the background, consumes `ledger-adjustments` Kafka topic
  (consumer group `ledger-worker`), reads `{accountId, delta, reason}` from each message,
  and applies a transactional balance adjustment to the Postgres `accounts` table,
  logging the adjustment to the `audits` table.

## The suite (`tests/ledger.e2e.yaml`)

Ten steps, one narrative — "a ledger transaction through REST, database, and an independent
worker consuming a message the suite injects":

### Step 1: `bridge-ledger-url` — `script.csharp`

The orchestrator stages the discovered `ledger-api` service URL at `Vars["svc::ledger-api"]`
before any step runs. But placeholders only match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` (no `:` or `-`),
so `{svc::ledger-api}` cannot be written as a token. This step reads the raw key and copies
it to the underscore-only `Vars["ledger_url"]`, which every later step references.

**GOTCHA:** `dotnet run --project <p>` sets the spawned process's working directory to
`<p>`, not your invoking shell's cwd. Relative paths passed to the runner resolve relative
to the project directory. The YAML comment in `ledger.e2e.yaml` line 16 documents this;
when in doubt, use absolute paths.

### Step 2: `create-account` — `rpc.json-rpc`

Calls `POST {ledger_url}/rpc` with method `createAccount`, params `{ownerName}`. No explicit
`expect` block (the call succeeds if it returns a result) — this step proves the RPC surface
accepts the request. Captures the generated `accountId` for all later steps.

### Step 3: `deposit-funds` — `rpc.json-rpc`

Calls `deposit(accountId, amount=500)`. Expects the returned `balance` to be exactly `500`
(proving the operation succeeded). Later queries and events must show this same balance.

### Step 4: `assert-balance-after-deposit` — `db-assert.postgres`

Queries `SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = @id` and asserts exactly one row with
`balance == "500"`. **Schema note:** the balance column is INTEGER, but `expect.row` declares
every value as a string (the provider reads `ToString()` on the column). Quoting the YAML
value `"500"` is therefore required, not stylistic — an unquoted `500` would fail JSON Schema
validation before the topology even starts.

### Step 5: `assert-deposit-event` — `mq-expect.kafka`

Polls the `ledger-events` topic for a message matching `type == "funds.deposited"` and
`accountId == {captured value}`. Uses `verifyMode: RETRY` (60s budget) because `publishEvent`
in the API runs after the HTTP response returns — the message may not have landed yet.

### Step 6: `withdraw-too-much` — `rpc.json-rpc`

Calls `withdraw(accountId, amount=10000)` where balance is only `500` — a **negative test**.
Expects the response to be a JSON-RPC error envelope with code `-32001` (INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS),
proving the domain rule enforces constraints. The account's balance is untouched.

### Step 7: `publish-chargeback-adjustment` — `mq-publish.kafka`

The suite itself injects a message onto the `ledger-adjustments` Kafka topic: `{accountId,
delta: -25, reason: "chargeback"}`. This bypasses the JSON-RPC surface entirely, targeting
only the worker role's independent consume-and-write path. The payload is a YAML single-quoted
string (starts with `{`, so YAML would parse it as flow-mapping if unquoted) carrying literal
JSON; `{placeholder}` substitution still runs on the resolved text.

### Step 8: `assert-balance-after-adjustment` — `db-assert.postgres`

Queries the balance again, now expecting `475` (`500 - 25`). Uses `verifyMode: RETRY` with
a 90-second budget — the longest of any step. A fresh consumer group joining a broker that only
just became healthy, plus the worker's transactional write, means this step is most likely to
need real polling headroom to succeed.

### Step 9: `get-closing-balance` — `rpc.json-rpc`

Calls `getAccount(accountId)` and captures the returned `balance` into `closing_balance`.
Closes the loop: the whole transaction was REST-initiated, so the suite reads it back the
same way.

### Step 10: `assert-arithmetic-invariant` — `script.csharp`

The final C# assertion: parse `closing_balance` (a JSON text capture, not a native int) and
verify it equals `500 - 25 == 475`. A thrown exception is caught by the framework and recorded
as `Verdict.Fail` (never an unhandled crash).

## Provider table

| Family | Provider | Technology | Version | Hub Link |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| `rpc` | `json-rpc` | Community (`Vouchfx.Community.JsonRpc` 1.0.0-alpha.1) | 1.0.0 | [vouchfx-providers](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx-providers/tree/main/community/Vouchfx.Community.JsonRpc) |
| `db-assert` | `postgres` | Core (PostgreSQL) | 1.0.0 | [vouchfx](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx) |
| `mq-publish` | `kafka` | Core (Apache Kafka) | 1.0.0 | [vouchfx](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx) |
| `mq-expect` | `kafka` | Core (Apache Kafka) | 1.0.0 | [vouchfx](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx) |
| `script` | `csharp` | Core (C# snippet) | 1.0.0 | [vouchfx](https://github.com/tomas-rampas/vouchfx) |

## How to run

This sample runs via its **custom runner**. The everyday path is the same as every other sample — `./scripts/run-sample.sh ledger-jsonrpc` auto-detects `runner/` and uses it — or invoke the runner directly:

```bash
# 1. Fetch and build the pinned engine (one-time, same as other samples)
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# 2. Build the sample's Docker image
docker build -t vouchfx-samples-ledger-jsonrpc:local samples/ledger-jsonrpc/app

# 3. Run via the custom runner (produces HTML + JUnit reports)
dotnet run --project samples/ledger-jsonrpc/runner -c Release -- \
  samples/ledger-jsonrpc/tests \
  --html out/ledger-report.html \
  --junit out/ledger-results.xml
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\scripts\bootstrap.ps1

docker build -t vouchfx-samples-ledger-jsonrpc:local samples/ledger-jsonrpc/app

dotnet run --project samples/ledger-jsonrpc/runner -c Release -- `
  samples/ledger-jsonrpc/tests `
  --html out\ledger-report.html `
  --junit out\ledger-results.xml
```

**Expected output:** 10 passed steps in ~40 seconds (depending on topology startup time, which
dominates). Reports land in `out/`:

- `out/ledger-results.xml` — JUnit XML for IDE/CI integrations
- `out/ledger-report.html` — interactive HTML report with step-by-step timeline, captures,
  assertions, and error details

**Diagnostic: list registered step kinds**

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/ledger-jsonrpc/runner --list
```

This prints every step kind the runner knows (Community + Core) without starting Docker or the
topology — useful to verify the custom runner wired both provider sets correctly. The runner's
list should show 5 step kinds (4 Core + 1 Community) — a custom runner registers only what it
explicitly references, demonstrating the minimal-bundle pattern for hub consumption.
